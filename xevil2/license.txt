XEVIL(TM) LICENSE AGREEMENT
-----------------------------
SCOPE
This license agreement covers XEvil version "2.0 beta 7" and all subsequent 
versions of XEvil starting with "2.", e.g. "XEvil 2.0 beta 8", "XEvil 2.0", 
"XEvil 2.51".  It does not cover XEvil version "2.0 beta 6" or any earlier 
version and does not cover any version starting with "3." or greater.


TERMINOLOGY
"Authors" means Steve Hardt and Michael Judge.

"XEvil License Agreement Dialog" means the window that appears immediately 
when XEvil is run and disappears before the game starts.  It displays the
entire text of this license agreement.

"Source Code" means all C/C++ files, graphics files, sound files, makefiles, 
project files, and any other files needed to build the final executable.


SHAREWARE
XEvil executables and the XEvil source code are shareware.  To support future
XEvil development, purchase an XEvil shareware registration for $20.  
 
The $20 shareware registration gives the registered person the right to run 
XEvil on one platform and gives that one person the right to use the XEvil 
source code for personal use.  Registration for additional platforms cost $10
each.  For example, if you want to run XEvil as a server on your FreeBSD 
machine and connect to it with XEvil running as a client on a Windows 95 
machine, you should pay for two platforms, $30.  There is one exception.  
Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT are different platforms, but payment 
for one is considered payment for all three.

The XEvil source code itself is shareware.  If you wish to use the XEvil
source code for your own use, including reading the code for personal 
education, you should pay the shareware fee.

We distribute the full implementation of XEvil, with all features enabled,
and distribute the complete source code.  We do not retain any way of forcing
you to register XEvil.  Instead, we hope you will get more than $20 worth of 
benefit out of XEvil and will show us your appreciation.  Invest in future 
XEvil features, graphics, sound, ports, bug fixes, etc. by paying the 
registration fee.


PAYMENT
Send check or money order to: 
XEvil 
P.O. Box 391530
Mountain View, CA 94039-1530

Make the check out to "Steve Hardt" and <IMPORTANT> write the version number
and operating system names in the memo portion of the check </IMPORTANT>.  
For example, "XEvil 2.0 Red Hat Linux", "XEvil 2.0 Windows 98", or 
"XEvil 2.0 Windows 95, Windows NT, Solaris".  Although you only have to pay 
for at most one of Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT, please tell us 
specifically which platforms you use.  This information helps us decide how 
to allocate our development and testing resources.


DISTRIBUTION
Executable:
The XEvil executable for any platform may be freely distributed provided this 
license agreement in its original and complete form is distributed along with 
the executable.  
 
The executable may be bundled as part of another product (e.g. shareware CD or
operating system) provided this license agreement in its original and complete
form is distributed along with the executable.  The bundled product must be 
set up so that the user sees the XEvil License Agreement Dialog every time 
XEvil is run.  This bundling is allowed only with the understanding that 
end-users should still pay the XEvil authors the shareware fee as described in
this agreement.  Purchase of another product that bundles XEvil does not 
imply purchase of an XEvil shareware registration.

Source code:
The XEvil source code may be freely distributed provided this 
license agreement in its original and complete form is distributed along with
the source.  As with the executable, bundling of the XEvil source code is 
allowed with the understanding that end-users should still pay the XEvil 
authors the shareware fee.


INSTALLATION
If XEvil is installed on a machine used by multiple users or installed on a 
network, it must be set up so that users see the XEvil license agreement 
dialog every time XEvil runs.  XEvil may only be configured to run without 
displaying the XEvil License Agreement Dialog if it is installed such that 
only one person uses it and if that person has paid the XEvil shareware 
registration fee.


MODIFYING THE EXECUTABLE OR SOURCE CODE
You may modify the XEvil executable and source code and make builds of XEvil
for other platforms.  Distribution of such executables is allowed only if the
original XEvil License Agreement Dialog with the original text is displayed
immediately when the program runs.  You may add additional dialogs or 
introductory screens, but the original XEvil License Agreement Dialog must 
appear first.   

Distribution of modified XEvil source code is permitted provided this license
agreement is distributed along with the source code and provided the entire
XEvil source code base is included.  

If you distribute a modified XEvil executable it must inform the user in some
way that it is not an original executable distributed by the authors.  If you
distribute modified XEvil source code, you must include a file in the top 
level directory of the distribution that gives a brief description of the 
changes.  This file must have a descriptive name, such as "changes.txt".  
You may not distribute modified XEvil source code or a modified executable 
with the intention of convincing others that it is the original source code
or executable.

You may not distribute a portion of the XEvil source code less than the entire
distribution, e.g. just the XEvil networking code.  In particular, every 
distributed version of the XEvil source code must include all code to display
the XEvil License Agreement Dialog immediately when XEvil runs.

A version of the XEvil source code that differs from the original XEvil source
code only in minor changes to the build script files made for the sole purpose
of compiling XEvil on some specific machine and platform is considered the 
original source code for the purposes of this agreement.  An executable built
from the original XEvil source code is considered an original executable.


COPYRIGHT OF MODIFICATIONS
The authors own the full copyright for all modified versions of XEvil.  If 
requested by the authors, you must send the authors copies of all source code
and executables for the modified version(s).  This includes all graphics, 
sound, and other media used in the modified version of XEvil.  By distributing
a modified version of XEvil, you are granting the authors copyright for your
modifications.


NO WARRANTY
This software is provided 'as is', without any express or implied warranty,
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and
performance of the program is with you.  Should the program prove defective,
you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

In no event will the authors be liable to you for damages, including any
general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use
or inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or
data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or
a failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if the
authors have been advised of the possibility of such damages.


EXCEPTIONS
If you wish to do something with XEvil disallowed by this agreement, contact
the authors.  We are reasonable people and we can probably work something out.
